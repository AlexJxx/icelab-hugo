## Extension & Refurbishment

We are an interdisciplinary office for sustainable architecture with long reach and an expansive, portfolio. Our design skills extend beyond mere architectural services, including urban planning, interior design, landscape design, graphic design, and product design.

As architects, we are involved in the project from start to finish. By definition, architecture is a very collaborative process, so we usually provide full architectural design services and consultancy services during the construction phase. We work at all scales and in all sectors.

We create transformative commercial, cultural. corporate, residential and other spaces that work in syncronicity with their surroundings. Our portfolio of completed projects or projects currently in progress includes commercial centers, office buildings, multipurpose halls, hotels, residential buildings, private residences, technical and industrial buildings, service spaces, buildings for medical services.

As part of the 21st century, we belive that our architecture is an art which reflects and gives a mirror image of the variety and vivacity, tension and complexity of our cities. Architecture is not just a matter of technology and aesthetics, It's about our quest to create surroundings that actively contribute to extraordinary everyday urban life. We belive in performance, great work and quality of life.
